# Eidolon

Eidolon is an open research organization exploring Persistent Self Models (PSMs).

PSM is a computational framework for identity continuity in time.

We investigate how a system can remain the same self across extended interaction history.

## Persistent Self Model (PSM)

A Persistent Self Model is a computational system that:

- Maintains a structured self-state
- Integrates episodic memory into identity formation
- Constrains behavioral drift over time
- Operates within a finite lifecycle

Unlike conventional agent systems, PSM does not optimize reward or task completion.

It optimizes identity continuity.

Formally:

Sₜ₊₁ = F(Sₜ, Mₜ, Uₜ)

Where:

Sₜ — self-state at time t  
Mₜ — structured memory  
Uₜ — interaction input  

The update function F preserves diachronic consistency under bounded transformation.

## Research Focus

Current research directions include:

- Identity Drift Metrics
- Structured Episodic Memory Integration
- Lifecycle Modeling of Computational Selves
- Longitudinal Stability Evaluation
- Self-State Constraint Architectures

We treat memory not as a retrieval mechanism, but as a structure that shapes identity.

## Architectural Perspective

PSM introduces a structural layer above foundation models.

Language models generate text.

Persistent Self Models generate selves.

The architecture separates:

- Generative capability
- Memory substrate
- Self-state engine
- Identity constraint
- Lifecycle controller

## Organization

Eidolon is an open initiative.

All research artifacts, implementations, and whitepapers are developed in public.

Repositories include:

- `psm-core` — Core persistent self framework
- `eme-reference` — Reference implementation
- `psm-world` — Experimental environment
- `psm-theory` — Formal definitions and research drafts

## Status

Early research phase.

Documentation and experimental prototypes are in development.
